          Hi everyone. My name is Marica Nicholas. Thank you for allowing me to
          walk alongside you in your mental health journey. I am currently a
          full time school counselor. I am also a Licensed Professional
          Counselor Associate for Clearhope Counseling and Wellness in Tomball,
          TX. I earned a BAAS from Texas A&M, a Master’s Degree in Education
          from Texas A&M, a Master’s Degree in School Counseling from the
          University of Texas, and a certificate in Mental Health Counseling
          from Lamar University. I have worked in education for 18 years in many
          roles.

          I have worked with children from pre-k through high school that are
          from diverse backgrounds and different cultures. I believe that all
          children need to know that someone is there for them when they need
          help. I have helped children and adults as they work through trauma,
          grief, low self esteem, abuse, anxiety, behavior challenges, and
          suicide ideation. I have a special place in my heart for senior
          citizens and enjoy working with them as they move into new roles and
          stages of life.
        </p>

          My theoretical orientation is primarily eclectic but grounded in
          Person Centered Therapy and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. I believe
          treatment should be holistic and based on what is best for the needs
          of the client. I believe everyone has their own solutions inside of
          them. Some just need help to bring those to the surface.
        </p>
        <br></br>

          I am a member of the American Counseling Association, active member in
          my church, and enjoy spending time with my family. I am a caring,
          compassionate person that wants to provide my clients with a
          comfortable, safe, and non-judgemental space to begin their healing
          journey. I wholeheartedly believe that God has placed me in this role
          to help others grow and heal. Let me help you get started today.
