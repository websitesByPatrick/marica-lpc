      <p>
          I am a member of the American Counseling Association, active member in
          my church, and enjoy spending time with my family. I am a caring,
          compassionate person that wants to provide my clients with a
          comfortable, safe, and non-judgemental space to begin their healing
          journey. I wholeheartedly believe that God has placed me in this role
          to help others grow and heal. Let me help you get started today.
