        <p>
          I have worked with children from pre-k through high school that are
          from diverse backgrounds and different cultures. I believe that all
          children need to know that someone is there for them when they need
          help. I have helped children and adults as they work through trauma,
          grief, low self esteem, abuse, anxiety, behavior challenges, and
          suicide ideation. I have a special place in my heart for senior
          citizens and enjoy working with them as they move into new roles and
          stages of life.
