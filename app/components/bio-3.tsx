      <p>
          My theoretical orientation is primarily eclectic but grounded in
          Person Centered Therapy and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. I believe
          treatment should be holistic and based on what is best for the needs
          of the client. I believe everyone has their own solutions inside of
          them. Some just need help to bring those to the surface.
